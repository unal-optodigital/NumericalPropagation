# NumericalPropagation
"NumericalPropagation" is a plugin developed to work on the well-known software for image processing [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) or any of its derivate platforms like [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) or [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/). It features angular spectrum, Fresnel-Fourier and [Fresnel-Bluestein](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/AO.49.006430) methods. Also includes an utilities tool, designed to work with complex data in the form of images.

Detailed and updated information about this project can be found in the [project page](https://unal-optodigital.github.io/NumericalPropagation/).

## Downloads
The installation process is the standard procedure for any ImageJ plugin. Just download either the [JAR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d1QIMhcpc1RHiRK99si26sKQuTEDmbkc/view?usp=sharing) or [ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tPDTYTA0ZU-KxoOeXGL02f5mCC9UIaoC/view?usp=sharing) file and extract its contents under the `imagej/plugins` folder. Once installed, you should be able to access the plugin at `OD > Numerical Propagation`
